# Asteroids
## Worked on from May 16, 2022 - May 23, 2022

Created Asteroids game in python that utilizes the pygame library and trignometric calculations to move in a spaceship and shoot asteroids. You are given 3 lives and every time you collide with an asteroid, you lose a life. Different size asteroids are worth different points: big is 1 point, medium is 5 points, and small is 10 points.

# Controls:
Movement: ```UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT``` or ```W, A, S, D```
Shooting: ```SPACE``` or ```MOUSE1```
